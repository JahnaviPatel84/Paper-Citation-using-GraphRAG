Based on the provided research paper, I'll extract and classify concepts, distinguishing between novel concepts introduced by the paper and existing concepts it utilizes. The output will be in the desired JSON format.

**Novel Concepts**

1. LLaMA
	* Name: LLaMA
	* Type: Foundation language models
	* Description: A collection of language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters, trained on trillions of tokens.
	* Key innovations: 
		+ Training state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary datasets.
		+ Achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters (e.g., LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3).
	* Advantages: 
		+ Democratize access and study of LLMs.
		+ Can be run on a single GPU.
	* Components: 
		+ Foundation language models with different parameter sizes (7B to 65B).
	* Limitations:
		+ Not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but can be inferred that LLaMA's performance might be limited by the availability of publicly available datasets.
	* Validation methods: 
		+ Showed that LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most benchmarks.

2. Scaling laws
	* Name: Scaling laws
	* Type: Methodology
	* Description: Determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training compute budget.
	* Key innovations:
		+ Introduced by Hoffmann et al. (2022).
		+ Ignores the inference budget.
	* Advantages:
		+ Provides a framework for scaling model and dataset sizes.
	* Components:
		+ Training compute budget.
		+ Dataset and model size scaling laws.
	* Limitations:
		+ Disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale.
	* Validation methods:
		+ Experimental results showing that training smaller models on more data can lead to better performance.

**Referenced Concepts**

1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
	* Name: LLMs
	* Type: Concept
	* Description: Language models trained on massive corpora of texts, capable of performing new tasks from textual instructions or a few examples.
	* Original source:
		+ Brown et al. (2020).
	* Usage in paper:
		+ Introduced as a concept that LLaMA builds upon.
2. Transformer
	* Name: Transformer
	* Type: Architecture
	* Description: A popular neural network architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
	* Original source:
		+ Vaswani et al. (2020).
	* Usage in paper:
		+ Implicitly used as a building block for LLaMA architecture.

**Relationships**

1. LLaMA builds upon the concept of LLMs.
	* Source concept: LLaMA
	* Target concept: LLMs
	* Relationship type: builds upon
	* Description: LLaMA is a specific instance of LLMs, trained on trillions of tokens.
	* Technical details: LLaMA's architecture is based on self-attention mechanisms and transformeers.

2. LLaMA extends the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al. (2022) but focuses on the inference budget.
	* Source concept: LLaMA
	* Target concept: Scaling laws
	* Relationship type: extends
	* Description: LLaMA builds upon the scaling laws but emphasizes the importance of the inference budget.
	* Technical details: LLaMA's architecture is designed to achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters, making it faster at inference.
