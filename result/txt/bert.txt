Based on the provided research paper, I will extract and classify concepts, distinguishing between novel concepts introduced by the paper and existing concepts it utilizes.

**Step 1: Concept Identification and Classification**

**Novel Concepts:**

1.  **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A novel language representation model that performs deep bidirectional pre-training from unlabeled text.
    *   Name: BERT
    *   Type: Language Representation Model
    *   Description: Bidirectional Encoder Model for Language Understanding
    *   Key Innovations:
        *   Jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers
        *   Deep bidirectional pre-training from unlabeled text
    *   Advantages:
        *   Achieves state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks
        *   Pushes the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement)
    *   Components:
        *   Bidirectional Encoder Model
        *   Transformer Architecture
    *   Limitations:
        *   None mentioned in the abstract
    *   Validation Methods:
        *   Experimentation on eleven natural language processing tasks

**Referenced Concepts:**

1.  **Transformer Architecture**: A widely used neural network architecture in natural language processing tasks.
    *   Name: Transformer Architecture
    *   Type: Neural Network Architecture
    *   Description: A type of neural network architecture used for natural language processing tasks
    *   Original Source: Vaswani et al. (2017)
    *   Usage in Paper: Used as the base architecture for the BERT model
2.  **Self-Attention Mechanism**: A attention mechanism used in many neural network architectures.
    *   Name: Self-Attention Mechanism
    *   Type: Attention Mechanism
    *   Description: An attention mechanism where each token can attend to every other token
    *   Original Source: Vaswani et al. (2017)
    *   Usage in Paper: Used in the original Transformer Architecture

**Step 2: Relationship Identification**

**Relationships between Novel Concepts:**

*   BERT:extends a Transformer Architecture with a deep bidirectional pre-training approach.

**Relationships with Referenced Concepts:**

*   BERT:extends a Transformer Architecture with self-attention mechanism.
*   BERT:uses a Transformer Architecture as its base architecture.

**Technical Details:**

*   The BERT model uses a deep bidirectional approach, conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.
*   The model uses a Transformer Architecture as its base architecture.
*   The BERT model uses the self-attention mechanism from the original Transformer Architecture.
